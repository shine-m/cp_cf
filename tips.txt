All numbers at most 10^5 have at most 128 divisors

in all recursive functions, first parameter gets called first except for the parameters in another called functions.

return fun(a)+fun(n);
                ^
                |
                this will be called first

return add( fun(a)+fun(n));
                                    ^
                                    |
                                    this will be  called first this time
                                    because both the parameters are inside another function call

(++mp.begin())->second     ||  is correct if we want to address to the second element of the  map        
whereas ++(mp.begin())->second    || is incorrect , it just increments the element value  in the first element     


two consecutive odd integers have gcd =1 always   ex: 13,15
two consecutive integers have gcd = 1 as well         ex: 13,14
